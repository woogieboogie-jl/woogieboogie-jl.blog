From day 1, Paris, the golden city, was shining bright.
My exchange uni - Sorbonne University is located in the heart of Paris, near the station Jussieu.

Oh, btw, I forgot to bring my sunglasses and it was super bright, the forcast saids that it will rain next week so it might be less hot to hang out.
